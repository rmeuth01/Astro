# Astro: Jetson Nano Handheld

## Description
 
The Retro Lite CM4 is a joint project between Dmcke5 and StonedEdge. The console is powered by a 4000mAh Li-Po and is designed to run with various software images, including but not limited to RetroPie, Lakka or Batocera, directly from an SD card or via eMMC storage. The project housing was inspired by a Nintendo Switch Lite, but is not a 100% match to the original. The CM4 cannot currently emulate most 32/64-bit consoles released after the PSP or Dreamcast. This means GameCube, Wii and 3DS are currently unplayable until the Foundation releases a newer version of the Compute Module line. wiringPi is now a deprecated GPIO library however does work with arm64 and aarch64, so you can install 64-bit RetroPie if you'd like. 

The Astro is an open-source gaming handheld based on the Jetson Nano single board computer.  It is designed to be built using off the shelf components and 3D printed parts.
